# Language Modeling Using Deep Learning

This repository presents a collection of papers about language modeling using Neural Networks.

Language modeling aims to assign a probability to the next word in a sentence and it is very important for the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although each NLP application has a different purpose, majority of the modern NLP applications build an artificial language model as a first step. After obtaining a trained (LM), it can be used in a variety of taks such as machine translation, speech recognition, question answering, handwriting recognition, text generation.
